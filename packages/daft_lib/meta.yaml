build:
  # Trigger the build of SDL2 and libhtml5 libraries with -fPIC (aka -sRELOCATABLE=1, within emscripten)
  #   - This module needs to link with SDL2 and html5 in two ways: javascript and native library.
  #     For SDL2, this corresponds to library_sdl.js and $EMSCRIPTEN_SYSROOT/lib/wasm32-emscripten/pic/libSDL2.a (fPIC version)
  #   - The fPIC version is not produced by default by emscripten, so we need to trigger its build below
  #   - Also, at link time, we need to specify the path to the fPIC version of libSDL2.a
  #
  # See https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/5248 for more explanations.
